# Sea of Stars TAS

This Tool Assisted Speedrun uses memory reading and branching logic to automate speedrunning Sea of Stars.
We are not necessarily aiming to be faster than the best human players but are trying to dynamically handle any situation the game has to offer.  
This project has been inspired by the [FFX TAS](https://github.com/coderwilson/FFX_TAS_Python) and [Evoland TAS](https://github.com/orkaboy/Evoland_TAS) that work in a similar fashion.  
Please join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/X6jaqdtZqn) if you are interested in contributing to the project.

## Current state

- 2023/08/11: The game has not yet been released so we are looking into the Demo to figure out the needed tools and memory locations.  
There currently is no functioning TAS or tooling.

## Setup

Install Python, clone the repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, start the game and then run `py main.py`.

## Contribute

If you want to contribute code, please run `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt` and `pre-commit install`.
